HTML_basics
------------
**How to start the program**
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>
```

**Simple page with title and some sentences**
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My poem</title>
   </head>
   <body>
    <h1>My heading<h2>
    <p>Example paragrapgh</p>
   </body>
<html>
```
```
<head> is used for the part of title line. 
We have various sizes of titles from h1 to h6.
<h1> is the biggest.  
<p> is for writing paragraph with normal letters. 
<br> stands for "break" and it enables to start on a new line.
```
**Text emphasis**
```
<em>くぁwせdrftgyふじこlp</em>
```
This shows Italic words

```
<strong>くぁwせdrftgyふじこlp</strong>
```
This shows bold words and they can be combined.

**Lists**

**Images**
```
<img src="URL OF PIC" alt="food" width="200"
```
you write link of the pic and write src= with it.  alt is for blind people. The automatic reading system would say "food" instead of pic. And you can arrange the size of pic with "width" and "height"
