The first computer appeared in the 1950s and 60s.
They were generally used within an organization

This is the origin of LAN (Ethernet)
The computers are all connected each other with a cable. 
And the computers send data based on MAC address

Ethernet enables to avoid collision of data transmisssion
(when two computers sends data to each other at the same time)
by detecting a collision and wait for a brief period before attempting to re-transmit 
(random peirod) so it won't be at the same time.
If they collide again, they wait more. And repeat it
